```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r} 
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

```



```{r}
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_df)

```

Check to see what are included in column notesRegCode
```{r}
unique(catch_df$notesRegCode)

```

Choose only columns of interest
```{r}

catch_df<-catch_df %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>% 
   gather(Species,catch,-Region,-Year)
```

```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
  rename(catch_thousands = catch)

head(catch_df)
```



Correct typo and change unit of catch column

```{r}
summary(catch_df)
```

```{r}
catch_integers <- as.integer(catch_df$catch_thousands)
```

```{r}
which(is.na(catch_integers))
```

```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>%
  mutate(catch_thousands = ifelse(catch_thousands == "I", 1, catch_thousands),
         catch_thousands = as.integer(catch_thousands))
```



#Analysis
```{r}
annual_catch<-catch_df %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(mean(catch_thousands))
head(annual_catch)
```

```{r}
catch_df %>% 
group_by(Year,Region) %>% 
  summarise(mean(catch_thousands))

```

```{r}
catch_df %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```

```{r}
catch_df %>% 
  filter(Region == "SSE") %>% 
  head() # head() Show just the first n (default:  6) rows
```

```{r}
catch_df %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>% 
  summarise(mean_catch = mean(catch_thousands)) %>% 
  arrange(mean_catch)
```


#Joining tables
```{r}
region_defs <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.303.1", method = "libcurl"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```


```{r}
region_defs <-region_defs%>% 
select(code,mgmtArea) %>% 
  rename(Region=code, Region_Name=mgmtArea)
head(region_defs)
```

```{r}
catch_joined<-left_join(catch_df,region_defs,by="Region")
head(catch_joined)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
